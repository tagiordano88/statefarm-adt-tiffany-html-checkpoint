    <h1>North Texas Travel Hockey</h1>
    <p>Hockey is pretty popular in Texas. There are several teams just in the DFW area. There are also several different
      levels of teams as well. There is a beginners league called a "house" league, high school league, and travel leagues.
    </p>
      
    <p>The competition to get on one of the travel teams is <strong>high</strong> and you have to start early.
      Players start by attending open skates and camps during the summer. Then there are tryouts to see if you 
      can make the cut. </p>
    <p>Here are a list of some the travel teams inside the DFW area:
